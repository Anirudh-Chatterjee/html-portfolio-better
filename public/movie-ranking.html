<h1>The Best Shows According to me</h1>
<h2>My Favorite Anime of All Time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>Absolutely goated show about pirates and you guessed it...One Piece itself.</p>

<h3>Kaguya Sama wa Kokurasetai</h3>
<p>One of the best if not the best Rom-Com anime out there.</p>

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>The Thousand Year Blood War arc carried it all. Bleach was kinda meh for me for the most of the show (manga fire tho), but the final arc is insane.</p>
